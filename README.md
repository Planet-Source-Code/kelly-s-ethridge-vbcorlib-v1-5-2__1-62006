## VBCorLib v1\.5\.2


</div>

### Description

This is a massive library that implements many of the useful classes found in the .NET mscorlib library. This upload is only a bugfix update. No new functionality was added. I only wanted to ensure everyone has the latest version in case they are experiencing one of the minor bugs. If you find any bugs, please let me know. Thank You! As always, support for this library can be found at http://www.kellyethridge.com/vbcorlib.
